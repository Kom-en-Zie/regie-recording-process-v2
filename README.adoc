This repository contains the scripts and configurations to set up an automated workflow for OBS recordings on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. The system automatically detects new OBS `.mkv` recordings, converts them to `.mp4` (H.264) and `.mov` (H.265), moves them to a designated NAS (or simulated NAS) directory, verifies the transfer, and cleans up the original recording.

[[features]]
== Features

* **Automated Monitoring:** Watches a specified OBS output directory for new `.mkv` files using `inotify-tools`.
* **Dual-Format Conversion:** Converts `.mkv` recordings to both H.264 (`.mp4`) and H.265 (`.mov`) formats using `FFmpeg`.
* **NAS Integration:** Moves converted files to a specified NAS (or simulated local directory) for storage.
* **Integrity Verification:** Checks for the presence of converted files on the NAS location before deleting originals.
* **Cleanup:** Automatically removes the original `.mkv` file after successful conversion and transfer.
* **Systemd Service:** Configured to run as a `systemd` service, ensuring the workflow starts automatically on boot and runs reliably in the background.

---

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
* OBS Studio (or any recording software that outputs `.mkv` files to the specified `RECORD_DIR`)

Before you begin, ensure you have `FFmpeg` and `inotify-tools` installed.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg inotify-tools -y
----

---

[[installation]]
== Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the automated workflow on your system.

=== 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your desired location. For example, in your home directory's `Documents` folder:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Kom\ \&\ Zie/Regie/Recording\ process/
cd ~/Documents/Kom\ \&\ Zie/Regie/Recording\ process/
git clone <repository_url> regie-recording-process-v2
cd regie-recording-process-v2
----
(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.)

=== 2. Create Directory Structure

The workflow expects a specific directory structure for input, conversion, and output. Create these folders:

[source,bash]
----
# These are examples
mkdir -p "~/Videos/OBS-output"
mkdir -p "~/Videos/Conversion folder"
mkdir -p "~/Videos/NAS-simulated"
----

=== 3. Configure Environment Variables

This project uses a `variables.sh` file to manage paths and other configuration settings.

Copy the example file and then edit it with your specific paths:

[source,bash]
----
cp variables.sh.example variables.sh
nano variables.sh
----

**Edit `variables.sh`:**

Replace the placeholder paths in `variables.sh` with your actual directory paths and username.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

# Directory where OBS saves new MKV recordings
RECORD_DIR="/home/your_user/Videos/OBS-output"

# Full path to the 'process_video.sh' script
PROCESS_SCRIPT="/home/your_user/Documents/regie-recording-process-v2/process_video.sh"

# Temporary directory for video conversions
CONVERT_DIR="/home/your_user/Videos/Conversion folder"

# Destination directory for converted files (simulated NAS)
NAS_DIR="/home/your_user/Videos/NAS-simulated"

# Path for the workflow log file
LOG_FILE="/home/your_user/Documents/workflow.log"
----
**Note:** `~` (tilde) is generally expanded by the shell, but it's safer to use the full `/home/your_user/` path in scripts that might be run by `systemd`.

Save and exit `nano` (`Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

=== 4. Make Scripts Executable

Ensure both `process_video.sh` and `start_listener.sh` have executable permissions:

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x process_video.sh
chmod +x start_listener.sh
----

=== 5. Create and Enable the systemd Service

To ensure the listener script runs automatically on system startup and restarts if it fails, we'll create a `systemd` service.

Create the service file using `sudo`:

[source,bash]
----
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/recording_workflow.service
----

Paste the following configuration. **It is critical to replace `your_user` with your actual username.** The service needs to run as your user to have the correct permissions for accessing your home directory and files.

[source,ini]
----
[Unit]
Description=Starts the video recording workflow listener for OBS.
After=network.target

[Service]
# IMPORTANT: Run the service as your user, not root
User=your_user
# The command to start the listener script (adjust path if your repo location differs)
ExecStart=/home/your_user/Documents/regie-recording-process-v2/start_listener.sh
# Restart the service if it ever fails
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Save and exit (`Ctrl + X`, `Y`, `Enter`).

Now, reload `systemd` to recognize the new service, enable it to start on boot, and start it immediately:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable recording_workflow.service
sudo systemctl start recording_workflow.service
----

---

[[usage]]
== Usage

Once the `systemd` service is enabled and started, the workflow will automatically begin monitoring your specified OBS recording folder (`RECORD_DIR`).

* When a new `.mkv` file is detected (after OBS finishes writing it), `process_video.sh` will be triggered.
* The script will convert the `.mkv` to `.mp4` and `.mov` in the `CONVERT_DIR`.
* The converted files will then be moved to the `NAS_DIR`.
* Upon successful transfer and verification, the original `.mkv` file will be deleted.

---

[[monitoring-and-troubleshooting]]
== Monitoring and Troubleshooting

You can check the status of the `systemd` service:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl status recording_workflow.service
----

To view the workflow logs and debug any issues, use `tail` to follow the `workflow.log` file:

[source,bash]
----
tail -f ~/Documents/Kom\ \&\ Zie/Regie/Recording\ process/workflow.log
----

---

[[scripts]]
== Scripts

This repository includes the following scripts:

=== `process_video.sh`

This script handles the video conversion, file movement, verification, and cleanup. It is triggered by `start_listener.sh` when a new recording is detected.

[source,bash]
----
include::process_video.sh[]
----

=== `start_listener.sh`

This script constantly monitors the `RECORD_DIR` for new `.mkv` files using `inotifywait`. When a new file is detected, it calls `process_video.sh` to begin the conversion workflow.

[source,bash]
----
include::start_listener.sh[]
----

=== `variables.sh.example`

An example file for `variables.sh`, which you must copy and modify with your specific directory paths. This file centralizes all configurable paths for the scripts.

[source,bash]
----
include::variables.sh.example[]
----
